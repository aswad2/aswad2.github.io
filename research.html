            <h2>üß† Huth Lab</h2>
            <p>from sophomore to senior year, i was an undergraduate researcher as part of the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huth/" target="_blank" class="lab-link">Huth Lab</a>
                at UT Austin, studying the intersection of <strong>neuroscience</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>. the lab does some really
                cool work in understanding how language is represented in the brain; in other words, we aim to discover what exactly goes on in our brains when we hear,
                read, or think something. my specific research task focused on <strong>reconstructing speech audio from fMRI-recorded brain signals.</strong></section></p>

            <p>as part of completing the turing scholars program, i wrote a thesis paper on my research and successfully defended my thesis in my senior year!  check it out if you're interested ‚¨áÔ∏è</p>

            <h2>üöó Self-Driving Routing Optimization</h2>
            <p>a cool research project i did my senior year of high school with the university of houston department of computer science. i worked on developing and evaluating routing algorithms for networks of self-driving cars, focusing on optimizing traffic flow while meeting vehicle deadlines.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>proposed a new dijkstra-based algorithm that optimized driving routes to reduce overall vehicular congestion while maximizing the number of deadlines met</li>
                <li>measured a <span class="highlight">32% improvement</span> in total travel time across all vehicles and a <span class="highlight">12% reduction</span> in deadlines missed</li>
                <li>submitted a work-in-progress research paper to the <span class="conference">IEEE Real Time Systems Symposium</span> conference</li>
